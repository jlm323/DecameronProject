            <p> My name is Megan Mills and I am currently a Junior at the <br/>
                University of Pittsburgh pursuing my Major in Communications. <br/>
                For this project I went through the stories to tag all the <br/>
                peoples names and created the graph of different places in different<br/> days. I also made the members page for the website.</p>
